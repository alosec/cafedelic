# Cafedelic Emacs Integration - Final Implementation

## Working Solution

We have successfully implemented a stable file tree visualization in Emacs that shows Claude's context window.

### What Works

1. **Left Sidebar Tree**
   - Uses existing `generate-file-tree.sh` script
   - Fixed 30-character width
   - Shows project structure starting from cafedelic root

2. **Stable Window Management**
   - Consistent two-pane layout
   - No buffer accumulation issues
   - Clean state management

3. **File Display**
   - Files open immediately in right pane
   - Creates "flipping through codebase" effect
   - Maintains file access history

### Key Decisions

1. **Hard-coded Project Root**: `/home/alex/code/cafedelic`
   - Removed smart detection for simplicity
   - Will be stored in database eventually

2. **Shell Script Integration**: 
   - Reused working `generate-file-tree.sh`
   - Better than complex elisp tree building

3. **Left Sidebar Layout**:
   - More natural than top/bottom split
   - Familiar IDE-like experience

### Known Issues

1. **Tree State**: Doesn't always refresh automatically
2. **No Persistence**: State lost between sessions
3. **Manual Only**: Not connected to DC logs yet

## Next Steps

1. **Database Integration**
   - SQLite for persistent state
   - Track file access patterns
   - Restore state on startup

2. **DC Log Connection**
   - Wire watcher to automatically open files
   - Real-time context window updates
   - Activity tracking

3. **Enhanced State Management**
   - Better tree refresh mechanism
   - File access timestamps
   - Context window analytics

## Lessons Learned

- Simple solutions work best (shell scripts > complex elisp)
- Stable window management requires explicit cleanup
- Hard-coding values is fine for prototypes
- Visual feedback (tree) enhances understanding
