[Main window rapidly flips through file contents as they're accessed]
```

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Minimal Display**: No decorative elements, just the tree
2. **File Organization**: Groups files by directory structure  
3. **Rapid Switching**: Files display immediately (flash effect)
4. **Space Efficient**: Reduced top window from 10 to 8 lines

## Test It

```bash
cd /home/alex/code/cafedelic/scripts/emacs
./test-rapid-flip.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- Clean tree structure
- Rapid file flipping as Claude reads
- Dynamic tree updates
- Project-relative paths

## Next Steps

- Wire to DC log watcher for automatic updates
- Add relative timestamps in tree
- Implement navigation keybindings
- Consider collapsible directories for large projects
