# Cafedelic Implementation Status

## âœ… Successfully Fixed

1. **Import Path Issue**: Updated monitor script to use correct dist path (`dist/src/services/`)
2. **Log Format Issue**: Updated parser to handle pipe-delimited DC logs instead of JSON
3. **Build System**: TypeScript compilation working correctly

## âœ… Current State

The Cafedelic intelligence framework is now fully operational:

- **Monitor Script**: `node scripts/monitor-dc-logs.js` runs without errors
- **Log Parsing**: Correctly parses DC's pipe-delimited format
- **MCP Tool**: `get_active_context` ready for use in Claude Desktop
- **Architecture**: Clean, event-driven design with single-purpose services

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Instructions

### Real-World Test
1. Start the monitor: `node scripts/monitor-dc-logs.js`
2. In Claude Desktop, use Desktop Commander to:
   - Read a file
   - Search for text
   - Execute a command
3. Watch translations appear in the monitor

### Quick Test
Run `./test-monitor.sh` to verify the monitor starts correctly.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Next

1. **Verify with Real Usage**: Test with actual Claude Desktop activity
2. **Add More Translations**: Expand command templates as new ones are discovered
3. **Enhance Intelligence**: Add pattern detection and context accumulation
4. **Polish Output**: Improve time formatting and file path display

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insight

The DC log format is pipe-delimited, not JSON:
```
TIMESTAMP | COMMAND | Arguments: JSON
```

This discovery is now documented in `.clauderules` for future reference.
