## ✅ Issue Updated with Enhanced Implementation Plan

Added the following key enhancements:

### New Tools
- **`send_special_key_to_pane`** - Send any special key (Enter, Escape, Tab, arrows, Ctrl combinations)
- **`send_ctrl_c_to_pane`** - Specific tool for Ctrl-C with double-tap support for Claude Code exit

### Implementation Highlights
1. **Shell Script Foundation** - Simple, debuggable bash scripts for all operations
2. **Key Mapping** - Friendly names (e.g., "ctrl-c") mapped to tmux sequences
3. **Claude Code Support** - Double-tap Ctrl-C for proper exit handling
4. **tmux-mcp Integration** - Optional integration path with https://github.com/nickgnd/tmux-mcp

### Architecture
```
Claude Desktop/Code → Cafedelic (WTE) → Shell Scripts → tmux panes
                           ↓
                    MCP Tools (configure routing)
```

### Next Steps
Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation focusing on core pane naming and interaction tools.
