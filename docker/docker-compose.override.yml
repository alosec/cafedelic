# Docker Compose Override - Local Development Network Fix
# 
# This file is automatically picked up by docker-compose and merges with docker-compose.yml
# It solves network issues during Docker builds on local development machines
#
# Problem: Docker build fails with "Temporary failure resolving 'deb.debian.org'"
# Solution: Use host network mode during build process only
#
# Note: This only affects the build process, not running containers
