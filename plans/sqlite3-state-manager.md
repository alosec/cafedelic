Cafedelic /
Let's move this project forward. 

Last session, we were super close to achieving something quite remarkable: live updates in emacs when claude reads files in the form of a self-creating directory tree file structure, and activation of emacs buffer within an emacsclient frame. 

The express server calls panes by name -- I think -- it might actually go by title 

In this session right now, the task is to create the context persistence model and state management engine that will drive the whole thing to function. This is a moment to take utmost care in ensuring that we do not design something that is going to create instant technical debt. 

Useful tools only, as core functions doing small things. Build piece by piece from testable components that together create big workflows. 

Here are some cool and interesting working things:

we can name panes using tools and read panes by name
we have a get_active_context which returns super basic yet useful context
we can extend get_active_context further to accept params or we can focus on creating better interpretability displays in the activity monitor pane maybe? we should call activity monitor "context window" though and make it explicitly about context
we should rescue the file tree from living in an emacs buffer to joining the pane party in pane 1. it's currently unnamed and like the rest of the panes we need to quickly give them the correct names -- whatever is needed by the express server to recognize and operate on.
mode:plan -- Let's chart an effective, careful path forward to create maintainable high quality software solving real problems through small, testable useful tools. 

Keep in sight the main goal to use Cafedelic as first and foremost a context window manager for the AI system as it works, and secondarily, a terminal canvas in tmux for performing highly complex workflows 

Also -- back on the todo list are more useful tmux functions. We definitely need to put the gh issue board some focus on tmux tools. Even dead simple ones like split_pane_horizontal and split_pane_vertical -- for basic navigational purposes, can instantly create a new pane, designate a name, and then start using for commands or logging or deploying a preset view like a file tree or another editor -- at a certain point we can have claude be a terminal ninja himself and skillfully use a highly complex 3x3 grid of a bunch of panes, all at once attacking a problem from many angles -- or intelligently displaying the code being edited in emacs -- I think emacs views will be able to largely automate completely even down to organizing files by areas of the codebase or files or whatever and even do it on the fly. cause we're just moving text views, and if we organize all this together and cross reference in a sqlite3 database instance -- WHICH CLAUDE HIMSELF CAN ALSO HANDLE .... and get_full_window_by_name and for panes get_full_pane_by_name -- all of this for contextual purposes 

The possibility that opens up by giving Claude an effective set of full-terminal access toolset for modulating views and using them effectively as real terminals in a working scenario ------ the potential here is wild. 

Let's get to work

Now let me understand the current architecture and what needs to be built for the context persistence model and state management engine. Based on the memory bank files and the user's requirements, I need to create a comprehensive plan that:

Establishes a context persistence model using SQLite3
Creates a state management engine for the whole system
Integrates with the existing DC log monitoring
Provides better tmux pane management tools
Enables Claude to use tmux as a terminal canvas
Let me create a comprehensive plan.

Context Persistence Model Design
Core Concept: Event-Sourced State Management
Instead of trying to maintain complex in-memory state, we'll use an event-sourced approach where every significant action is logged to SQLite3, allowing us to reconstruct state at any point and providing natural audit trails.

State Management Engine Architecture
typescript
// Core state manager that coordinates everything
class StateManager extends EventEmitter {
    private persistence: PersistenceService;
    private contextWindow: ContextWindowService;
    private paneCoordinator: PaneCoordinatorService;
    
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.setupEventHandlers();
    }
    
    // Central event hub - all state changes flow through here
    private setupEventHandlers() {
        // From DC logs
        this.on('dc:file-accessed', this.handleFileAccess);
        this.on('dc:command-executed', this.handleCommand);
        
        // From tmux
        this.on('pane:created', this.handlePaneCreated);
        this.on('pane:focused', this.handlePaneFocused);
        
        // From user actions
        this.on('context:requested', this.handleContextRequest);
    }
    
    // Coordinated state updates
    async handleFileAccess(event: FileAccessEvent) {
        // 1. Log to database
        await this.persistence.logFileAccess(event);
        
        // 2. Update context window
        await this.contextWindow.addFile(event.filePath);
        
        // 3. Coordinate pane display
        if (event.shouldDisplay) {
            await this.paneCoordinator.displayFile(event.filePath);
        }
        
        // 4. Emit state change for UI updates
        this.emit('state:updated', await this.getFullState());
    }
}
Context Window Service
typescript
class ContextWindowService {
    private activeFiles: Map<string, FileContext>;
    private maxContextSize: number = 1_000_000; // 1MB default
    
    async addFile(filePath: string) {
        const stats = await fs.stat(filePath);
        const context: FileContext = {
            path: filePath,
            size: stats.size,
            addedAt: new Date(),
            lastAccessed: new Date(),
            accessCount: 1
        };
        
        this.activeFiles.set(filePath, context);
        this.pruneIfNeeded();
    }
    
    getContextMetrics(): ContextMetrics {
        return {
            totalFiles: this.activeFiles.size,
            totalSize: Array.from(this.activeFiles.values())
                .reduce((sum, f) => sum + f.size, 0),
            oldestFile: this.getOldestFile(),
            mostAccessed: this.getMostAccessedFiles(5)
        };
    }
}
Pane Coordinator Service
typescript
class PaneCoordinatorService {
    private namedPanes: Map<string, PaneState>;
    
    async displayFile(filePath: string, paneName: string = 'cafedelic-editor') {
        const pane = this.namedPanes.get(paneName);
        if (!pane) {
            throw new Error(`Pane ${paneName} not found`);
        }
        
        // Send file to appropriate viewer
        if (pane.contentType === 'editor') {
            await this.openInEmacs(filePath, pane);
        } else if (pane.contentType === 'terminal') {
            await this.displayInTerminal(filePath, pane);
        }
        
        // Update state
        pane.currentFile = filePath;
        await this.persistence.updatePaneState(pane);
    }
    
    async createPane(config: PaneConfig): Promise<PaneState> {
        // Use tmux tools to create pane
        const paneId = await this.tmuxCreatePane(config);
        
        // Track in state
        const paneState: PaneState = {
            name: config.name,
            paneId,
            contentType: config.type,
            createdAt: new Date()
        };
        
        this.namedPanes.set(config.name, paneState);
        return paneState;
    }
}
New Tmux Tools Design
Basic Pane Operations
typescript
// split_pane_horizontal.ts
interface SplitPaneHorizontalParams {
    target?: string;      // Target pane (name or ID)
    size?: number;        // Percentage or lines
    command?: string;     // Command to run in new pane
    name?: string;        // Name for new pane
}

// split_pane_vertical.ts  
interface SplitPaneVerticalParams {
    target?: string;
    size?: number;
    command?: string;
    name?: string;
}

// get_full_window_by_name.ts
interface WindowState {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    layout: string;
    panes: PaneState[];
    active: boolean;
}

// get_full_pane_by_name.ts
interface FullPaneState {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    title: string;
    size: { width: number; height: number };
    position: { x: number; y: number };
    content: string[];  // Last N lines
    command: string;    // Current running command
    focused: boolean;
}
Integration Strategy
Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
Create SQLite3 schema and persistence service
Implement basic state manager with event bus
Wire DC log watcher to emit state events
Create basic tmux pane tools
Phase 2: Context Engine (Next)
Implement context window tracking
Add file relationship detection
Create activity analytics
Build pane coordinator
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
3x3 grid management for complex workflows
Auto-layout based on task type
Predictive file opening
Context persistence across sessions
Key Design Principles
Event-Sourced Truth: Database is source of truth, memory is cache
Loose Coupling: Services communicate via events, not direct calls
Progressive Enhancement: Each feature works independently
Fail Gracefully: Missing panes/files don't crash the system
Human-Centric: All data structures optimize for human understanding
Success Metrics
File access patterns visible in real-time
Context window size tracked and manageable
Pane states persist across restarts
Complex workflows possible with grid layouts
Zero data loss on crashes
Do you approve this plan? If yes, I'll proceed to implementation in ACT mode.

#### Scribbles

Task: Connect DC log watcher to automatically open files in Emacs when Claude accesses them

We'll implement this with a simple view state manager addition which involves the use of an sqlite3 instance to track the structured data we're keeping about the working context. 

Initial db schema requires at least a few data points: 

Currently open files ... aaaand ... I am not sure what else at this time. Currently open files is all that comes to mind, somewhat surprisingly. I am certain there are other metrics that will be necessary to track at the start but they're escaping me at the moment. 

Anyways, Claude: please review the project context and code and documentation to get  up to speed to the working context. We are buidling a "glass box" context-window-manager in tmux using emacs and bash scripts with an express server with watch capabilities. 

Our basic data flow right now is we have a watch function watching a log file from an MCP server called Desktop Commander, which provides some really impressive functions to Claude Desktop for doing comprehensive editing. We're now going to turn our attention to this and move forward in this way.

----

We just found a really cool tool named tmex which is an auto layout script for tmux which accepts relatively complex number / formatting arguments and arranges panes in tmux accordingly. 

For example, 

tmex 111 produces a layout in the current window with three equally sized panes in the form of columns. 

tmex 111 --transpose does the same thing but transposed, of course, so it produces three equally proportioned row panes.

tmex 123 will produce 1 column on left, 2 rows in one column in middle, and 3 rows in one column on right. 

One that I particularly like is 131 --transpose but it's not even the full hot dog that I'm seeking either -- I don't really know what it is that I'm seeking... better tmux layouting on the fly that is also super scriptable, really. 

Ideal situation is that we can easily create various layout scripts / modify existing scripts to name panes and windows for use by the cafedelic project, now powered by tmex layouting script instead of writing tmux scripts directly ourselves.

This provides a super powerful modular matrix that can absolutely be turned into a functional mcp tool but right now we just need to understand it a little bit more deeply. 

Directly iterating on tmux panes is kind of tedious, so I want to strengthen our iterate-test-refactor loop by having an effective way of seeing the resulting layouts from particular tmex commands. 

I'm serious, the layouting functionality is pretty wild in terms of what it can produce, check out the main readme from the repo:

https://github.com/evnp/tmex/tree/main

Ideal situation is that I have two panes in a window and I can run tmex commands in one pane and see them live in the other pane. We should devise a script wrapper for tmex which accomplishes this. 

Goal right now is to create tmex-test-deploy or something like that which is literally just a wrapper for tmex that just deploys the layout to the adjacent pane, or something, or to a specified window/session for review.

To be honest, I don't think that's actually a very good idea. But what I really want is some way to visually see the results of a layout without having to tediously do all the window and pane management myself. 

Does it make sense what I'm asking? Can you help me figure out what it is what I want and need here?

This is relevant to cafedelic because I'm wanting to change the layouting approach I'm taking with cafedelic, but need something like tmex to make it easier, because manually dealing with creating scripts for tmux is kind of hellish. The tools are powerful but inaccessible and super confusing -- I can learn tmux deeply and self-write these insane scripts, sure, but hoooly shit that feels like a big undertaking and a huge distraction from what I really want to be doing with the project -- and if I can learn tmex well enough then I can probably actually transfer that knowledge very easily, and it can be more reproducible in general. 

I think we should look at creating the directory scripts/tmex/ and iterating on methods for testing and viewing new layouts made with tmex

We have some existing scripts right now but it's pretty half-baked. Not really a full test suite / iterative engine that I really want.
