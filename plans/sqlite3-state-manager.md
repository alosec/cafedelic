Task: Connect DC log watcher to automatically open files in Emacs when Claude accesses them

We'll implement this with a simple view state manager addition which involves the use of an sqlite3 instance to track the structured data we're keeping about the working context. 

Initial db schema requires at least a few data points: 

Currently open files ... aaaand ... I am not sure what else at this time. Currently open files is all that comes to mind, somewhat surprisingly. I am certain there are other metrics that will be necessary to track at the start but they're escaping me at the moment. 

Anyways, Claude: please review the project context and code and documentation to get  up to speed to the working context. We are buidling a "glass box" context-window-manager in tmux using emacs and bash scripts with an express server with watch capabilities. 

Our basic data flow right now is we have a watch function watching a log file from an MCP server called Desktop Commander, which provides some really impressive functions to Claude Desktop for doing comprehensive editing. We're now going to turn our attention to this and move forward in this way.

We just found a really cool tool named tmex which is an auto layout script for tmux which accepts relatively complex number / formatting arguments and arranges panes in tmux accordingly. 

For example, 

tmex 111 produces a layout in the current window with three equally sized panes in the form of columns. 

tmex 111 --transpose does the same thing but transposed, of course, so it produces three equally proportioned row panes.

tmex 123 will produce 1 column on left, 2 rows in one column in middle, and 3 rows in one column on right. 

One that I particularly like is 131 --transpose but it's not even the full hot dog that I'm seeking either -- I don't really know what it is that I'm seeking... better tmux layouting on the fly that is also super scriptable, really. 

Ideal situation is that we can easily create various layout scripts / modify existing scripts to name panes and windows for use by the cafedelic project, now powered by tmex layouting script instead of writing tmux scripts directly ourselves.

This provides a super powerful modular matrix that can absolutely be turned into a functional mcp tool but right now we just need to understand it a little bit more deeply. 

Directly iterating on tmux panes is kind of tedious, so I want to strengthen our iterate-test-refactor loop by having an effective way of seeing the resulting layouts from particular tmex commands. 

I'm serious, the layouting functionality is pretty wild in terms of what it can produce, check out the main readme from the repo:

https://github.com/evnp/tmex/tree/main

Ideal situation is that I have two panes in a window and I can run tmex commands in one pane and see them live in the other pane. We should devise a script wrapper for tmex which accomplishes this. 

Goal right now is to create tmex-test-deploy or something like that which is literally just a wrapper for tmex that just deploys the layout to the adjacent pane, or something, or to a specified window/session for review.

To be honest, I don't think that's actually a very good idea. But what I really want is some way to visually see the results of a layout without having to tediously do all the window and pane management myself. 

Does it make sense what I'm asking? Can you help me figure out what it is what I want and need here?

This is relevant to cafedelic because I'm wanting to change the layouting approach I'm taking with cafedelic, but need something like tmex to make it easier, because manually dealing with creating scripts for tmux is kind of hellish. The tools are powerful but inaccessible and super confusing -- I can learn tmux deeply and self-write these insane scripts, sure, but hoooly shit that feels like a big undertaking and a huge distraction from what I really want to be doing with the project -- and if I can learn tmex well enough then I can probably actually transfer that knowledge very easily, and it can be more reproducible in general. 

I think we should look at creating the directory scripts/tmex/ and iterating on methods for testing and viewing new layouts made with tmex

We have some existing scripts right now but it's pretty half-baked. Not really a full test suite / iterative engine that I really want.
