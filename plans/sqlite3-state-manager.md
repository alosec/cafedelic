Task: Connect DC log watcher to automatically open files in Emacs when Claude accesses them

We'll implement this with a simple view state manager addition which involves the use of an sqlite3 instance to track the structured data we're keeping about the working context. 

Initial db schema requires at least a few data points: 

Currently open files ... aaaand ... I am not sure what else at this time. Currently open files is all that comes to mind, somewhat surprisingly. I am certain there are other metrics that will be necessary to track at the start but they're escaping me at the moment. 

Anyways, Claude: please review the project context and code and documentation to get  up to speed to the working context. We are buidling a "glass box" context-window-manager in tmux using emacs and bash scripts with an express server with watch capabilities. 

Our basic data flow right now is we have a watch function watching a log file from an MCP server called Desktop Commander, which provides some really impressive functions to Claude Desktop for doing comprehensive editing. We're now going to turn our attention to this and move forward in this way.
