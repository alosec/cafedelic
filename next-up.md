next up for this project, continuing to build and refine the concept of a Claude powered tmux based IDE:

simplify cafedelic MCP tool structure, reduce number of available tools 

enhance tool accessibility by repositioning tools as firstly CLI aliases. For example we need "cafe make" or equivalent for deploying the cafedelic IDE to a particular tmux window. For now, we'll refocus cafedelic as a Claude Code powered AI pair programming IDE. 

Anthropic released the Claude Code SDK today, meaning that we are not going to be able to implement Claude Code async or sync execution via the existing in-use package @anthropic-ai/claude-code -- You can web search about this to find more info using your web search tools or firecrawl 

We should consider prioritizing the deployment of programmatically generated text pieces made with CC to tmux panes. Existing send-keys type implementation works but I've also been wondering about deploying a client type object to the tmux pane. Then, clients could read db entries and display, like a reactive type design, rather than relying purely on tmux send-keys to pane to deploy a view like we're now doing with the emacs 

one concrete goal: develop the status pane. The status pane communicates key information about the existing cafedelic deployment. Should include tracking of all running claude code sessions. Assignment of human-readable names (session id's are long and painful) 

CCmanager repo might be helpful. Bills itself as a tmux free way of managing multiple claude code sessions. Ergo, if it's made without tmux, it can probably be cleanly integrated with it somehow. I thought there was a repo I found for managing various sessions by id, I thought it was this one, guess not. I'll try and find that repo about managing multi claudes by session id as that would be super helpful in terms of buiding a thing here for cafedelic. That would be a great base and we could just.. idk 

The claude code SDK looks awesome, very easy way to say, for example, designate the status pane, and then use a claude call to ask, hey, read these panes. These panes are from the cafedelic workspace. What's up right now? Show Current Task display. Then, by analysis of the logs from both claude desktop and claude code, intelligently and dynamically populate another field like Current Focus: or Recent Tasks -- analyzing logs to produce direct, clear, brief insights about the current objective for enhanced AI interpretability.
