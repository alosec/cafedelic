# Initialize Claude Instance

## Problem Statement

When starting a Claude Code instance in a tmux pane for testing or collaboration, there's no standardized way to:
1. Initialize the instance with context about its purpose
2. Set it to planning mode to avoid premature implementation
3. Provide it with the necessary background about the testing scenario

## Proposed Solution

Create a standardized initialization protocol for Claude instances that:
- Provides context about the testing environment
- Sets appropriate mode (PLAN vs ACT)
- Shares relevant project context
- Establishes communication patterns

## Benefits

- Consistent Claude instance behavior
- Better testing workflows
- Clear separation between planning and execution
- Reduced miscommunication during multi-agent scenarios

## Implementation Ideas

- MCP tool to initialize Claude with predefined templates
- Shell script to send initialization messages
- Configuration for different initialization scenarios

## Priority

Medium - Would improve testing workflows but not blocking current development
