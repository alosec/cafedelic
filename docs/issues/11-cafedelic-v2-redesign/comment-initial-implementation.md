# Initial Implementation Complete âœ…

The core WTE pattern is now implemented in the `cafedelic-v2` worktree!

## What's Done

### Core Implementation (~150 lines total)
- âœ… WTE interface and runner
- âœ… MCP log watcher 
- âœ… File operation transforms
- âœ… Emacs executor
- âœ… Working file-to-emacs pipeline

### Key Stats
- **Lines of code**: ~150 (vs ~2000 in v1)
- **Files**: 13 small, focused modules
- **Dependencies**: Just TypeScript and Node.js
- **Build time**: < 1 second

### Working Example

```typescript
// The entire pipeline in one file
export const fileToEmacs: WTE<LogEntry, FileAction> = {
  watch: watchMCPLogs,
  transform: extractFileOperation,
  execute: openInEmacs
};
```

## Running It

```bash
cd cafedelic-v2
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Next Steps

1. Test with real Claude Desktop logs
2. Implement write-to-diff pipeline
3. Add minimal pane configuration
4. Validate feature parity

The simplicity is remarkable - each file is 10-40 lines, easily understood in isolation, yet they compose into the full functionality we need.
