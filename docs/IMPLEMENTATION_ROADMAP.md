# Implementation Roadmap: Cafedelic Intelligence Platform

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a pragmatic, iterative approach to building the Cafedelic Intelligence Platform. Rather than attempting to build everything at once, we'll deliver incremental value through focused phases that build upon each other.

## Development Philosophy

### Iterative Value Delivery
- **Start Simple**: Begin with the most basic functionality that provides immediate value
- **Build Incrementally**: Each phase adds substantial user value while maintaining working software
- **Validate Early**: Get user feedback at each phase to inform subsequent development
- **Foundation First**: Establish solid technical foundations before adding complex features

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Proven Technologies**: Leverage mature frameworks (Textual, SQLite, TypeScript)
- **Minimal Viable Features**: Focus on essential functionality over feature completeness
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure each phase works standalone if subsequent phases are delayed
- **User-Centric**: Prioritize features that directly improve developer workflow

## Phase 1: Foundation and Basic TUI (Weeks 1-3)

### Goal
