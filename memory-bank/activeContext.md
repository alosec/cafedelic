# Active Context

## Current State
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Focus**: Ready for Claude Desktop visibility and Claude Code integration
- **Status**: V2 redesign complete, WTE pattern fully implemented

## Recent Changes
- Completed v2 architectural redesign with Watch-Transform-Execute pattern
- Successfully merged to main (commit 6013806)
- Reduced codebase from ~2000 to ~150 lines
- Closed issue #11 documenting the journey
- Removed redundant cafedelic-v2 worktree

## Current Architecture (V2 - WTE)
```typescript
// Core pattern - entire system in ~150 lines
pipe(
  mcpLogWatcher(logPath),
  fileOperationTransform,
  emacsExecutor(scriptPath)
);
```

### Key Components
1. **Watch**: Direct MCP log observation via readline
2. **Transform**: Simple JSON parsing and filtering
3. **Execute**: Shell script execution for Emacs
4. **Compose**: Functional pipeline with `pipe()` utility

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Core WTE pattern implemented
- ✅ MCP log watching functional
- ✅ Emacs integration working
- ✅ File operations pipeline complete
- ✅ 10x code reduction achieved
- ✅ Merged to main and deployed

## Ready For Next Phase

### Claude Desktop Integration
- Framework ready for shared workspace visibility
- Simple pipeline makes feature addition straightforward
- Can add new watchers/transforms with minimal effort
- Clean composition model supports any data flow

### Claude Code Integration
- Architecture supports direct tool integration
- No complex abstractions to navigate
- Each pipeline stage is independent and testable
- Easy to add new execution targets

## Next Steps
1. Implement Claude Desktop visibility features
   - Add more transform types for different operations
   - Create visual feedback pipelines
   - Build activity monitoring transforms

2. Add Claude Code tool integration
   - Create watchers for Code-specific operations
   - Build transforms for code analysis
   - Add executors for code actions

3. Enhance pipeline capabilities
   - Add filtering and routing options
   - Build conditional execution paths
   - Create pipeline composition tools

## Technical Achievement
- **Before**: 17 files, complex services, generic hell
- **After**: Single entry point, clear data flow, functional composition
- **Result**: Same functionality, 10x less code, infinitely more maintainable

## Available MCP Tools (Still Working)
All the MCP tools developed during v1 remain functional:
- `setEditorDestination(paneSpec)` - Route to tmux panes
- `create_tmex_layout(targetPane, layout)` - Create layouts
- `toggle_auto_open(enable?)` - Control auto-opening
- Plus all other routing and layout tools

## Development Velocity
With the v2 architecture, adding new features is now:
1. Add a watcher (if new data source)
2. Add a transform (for new data shape)
3. Add an executor (for new action)
4. Compose with `pipe()`

No more navigating service hierarchies or fighting TypeScript generics.
