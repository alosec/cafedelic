# Active Context

## Current State (2025-05-26)

### Back to Basics - Single Agent Focus
After exploring multi-agent orchestration, we've returned to focusing on perfecting single-agent Claude Desktop integration. The multi-agent work has been archived in `feature/multi-agent-experiment` branch for potential future use.

### What's Working Well ✅
1. **DC Log Watching**: Successfully monitors and translates Desktop Commander logs
2. **Tab Character Parsing**: Fixed robust parsing of DC logs with tab characters
3. **Basic Activity Tracking**: Shows what Claude is doing in human-readable format  
4. **Simple MCP Integration**: `get_active_context` returns activity summaries
5. **Dired Integration**: Auto-opens directories when Claude explores them
6. **Tmux Output Routing**: Routes emacs output to session 9:0.2 for visibility
7. **IDE Layout**: Clean 5-pane tmux layout with tmex

### Immediate Focus Areas

#### 1. Output Routing Management System (GitHub Issue #4)
**Status**: Documented and tracked for future implementation
- Replace hard-coded tmux pane destinations with flexible routing system
- Add emacs daemon lifecycle management 
- Create dynamic source → destination assignment capabilities
- Enable runtime configuration without code changes

#### 2. Perfect DC Log Translation
- Add more command templates as we discover them
- Improve file path formatting and display
- Group related activities intelligently

#### 3. Test with Real Claude Desktop
- Verify all translations are accurate with fixed tab parsing
- Ensure directory auto-opening works with emacs daemon
- Gather feedback on what's most helpful

## Active Development

### Emacs Daemon Management (GitHub Issue #5)
**Status**: Implemented by Marcel - Socket Fix Needed
- Marcel successfully implemented EmacsDaemonManager service
- Daemon runs with socket name: cafedelic-[PID]
- **Issue Found**: EmacsService doesn't pass socket name to scripts
- **Fix Required**: Add CAFEDELIC_SOCKET_NAME to script environment
- See `/docs/issues/update-issue-4-socket-fix.md` for details

### Agent Messaging Tool (GitHub Issue #6)
**Status**: Documented for implementation
- Current `send_to_pane` strips code blocks and formatting
- Proposed `send_message_to_agent(mode, content)` tool
- Will preserve technical content and code examples
- Essential for multi-agent coordination

### Emacs Integration Improvements (GitHub Issue #9)
**Status**: Documented for implementation
- Implement plain `emacs` mode alongside daemon mode
- Fix tmux overlay display issues
- Add configuration toggle between modes
- Multiple overlay fix strategies documented

### Docker Worktree Testing Framework (GitHub Issue #10)
**Status**: Documented for implementation
- 4+ parallel server configurations in Docker
- Git worktrees for isolated experiments
- Tmux visualization of all experiments
- Automated testing with Claude Code
- Staging branch workflow for successful experiments

## Pane Organization (Session 9)

All panes now have French names for easy reference:
- **Pierre** (9:0.0): Activity Monitor - DC logs human-readable view
- **Amelie** (9:0.1): File Tree - Project navigation  
- **Sophie** (9:0.2): Emacs Editor - Main editing pane
- **Marcel** (9:0.3): Claude Code - Implementation agent
- **Jacques** (9:0.4): DC Logs Monitor - Raw log view
- **Henri** (9:0.5): Additional workspace

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Marcel's Implementation**
   - Emacs daemon manager development
   - Test when implementation complete
   - Verify auto-file opening works seamlessly

2. **Polish Core Features**
   - Refine translation templates
   - Improve activity formatting
   - Add missing DC commands

3. **Simple Enhancements**
   - Activity grouping by time
   - Better path display
   - Clear activity indicators

## Design Principles

- **Keep it simple**: No databases, no complex state
- **Make it reactive**: Respond to Claude's actions immediately
- **Focus on visibility**: Show what Claude is doing clearly
- **Perfect one agent**: Before considering multi-agent again

## Success Criteria

By end of next session:
- [ ] All common DC commands translated perfectly
- [ ] File/directory opening works seamlessly
- [ ] Activity stream is clear and helpful
- [ ] Ready to add Claude Code support

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

- ❌ Multi-agent context management (archived)
- ❌ Database persistence
- ❌ Complex pane routing
- ❌ State management beyond current session

Keep the focus tight and the implementation clean!
