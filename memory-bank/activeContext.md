# Active Context

## Current State (2025-05-26)

### Back to Basics - Single Agent Focus
After exploring multi-agent orchestration, we've returned to focusing on perfecting single-agent Claude Desktop integration. The multi-agent work has been archived in `feature/multi-agent-experiment` branch for potential future use.

### What's Working Well ✅
1. **DC Log Watching**: Successfully monitors and translates Desktop Commander logs
2. **Tab Character Parsing**: Fixed robust parsing of DC logs with tab characters
3. **Basic Activity Tracking**: Shows what Claude is doing in human-readable format  
4. **Simple MCP Integration**: `get_active_context` returns activity summaries
5. **Dired Integration**: Auto-opens directories when Claude explores them
6. **Tmux Output Routing**: Routes emacs output to session 9:0.2 for visibility
7. **IDE Layout**: Clean 5-pane tmux layout with tmex
8. **TMEX Layout Tools**: New MCP tools for tmux layout manipulation
   - `create_tmex_layout()`: Deploy tmex layouts to any pane
   - `capture_layout_state()`: Get geometric analysis of layouts
   - `clear_tmux_panes()`: Clear panes with verification

### Immediate Focus Areas

#### 1. Output Routing Management System (GitHub Issue #4)
**Status**: Documented and tracked for future implementation
- Replace hard-coded tmux pane destinations with flexible routing system
- Add emacs daemon lifecycle management 
- Create dynamic source → destination assignment capabilities
- Enable runtime configuration without code changes

#### 2. Perfect DC Log Translation
- Add more command templates as we discover them
- Improve file path formatting and display
- Group related activities intelligently

#### 3. Test with Real Claude Desktop
- Verify all translations are accurate with fixed tab parsing
- Ensure directory auto-opening works with emacs daemon
- Gather feedback on what's most helpful

## Active Development

### Pane-Specific Emacs Servers (2025-05-27) ✅
**Status**: Shell scripts working, MCP tools need debugging
- Implemented complete pane-server mode bypassing daemon complexity
- Each tmux pane can have independent emacs server
- Shell scripts fully functional for start/open operations
- MCP tool integration has parameter passing issues
- **Next Priority**: Fix activity monitor for Claude Desktop MCP logs

### Agent Messaging Tool (GitHub Issue #6)
**Status**: Documented for implementation
- Current `send_to_pane` strips code blocks and formatting
- Proposed `send_message_to_agent(mode, content)` tool
- Will preserve technical content and code examples
- Essential for multi-agent coordination

### Emacs Integration Improvements (GitHub Issue #9)
**Status**: Documented for implementation
- Implement plain `emacs` mode alongside daemon mode
- Fix tmux overlay display issues
- Add configuration toggle between modes
- Multiple overlay fix strategies documented

### Cafedelic Multi-Server Development Platform (GitHub Issue #10)
**Status**: Enhanced vision documented
- Core cafedelic vision: parallel AI-assisted development
- Debian 12 Docker containers with color identities (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- Dynamic worktree discovery (no hardcoding)
- Tmux grid: 3 panes per server (editor, terminal, Claude Code)
- Shared database across all instances
- Ultimate goal: `deploy_cafedelic()` function for instant environment setup
- First meaningful milestone: "Four Colors Dancing" - all servers visible in grid

### TMEX Layout Tools (2025-05-26)
**Status**: Implemented as simple shell script wrappers
- Created three MCP tools for tmux layout control:
  - `create_tmex_layout(targetPane, layout)`: Deploy any tmex layout pattern
  - `capture_layout_state(target?)`: Get geometric analysis with pane positions/sizes
  - `clear_tmux_panes(target, mode, verify?)`: Clear with multiple strategies
- Architecture decision: Simple wrappers over existing shell scripts
- Enables Claude to experiment with layouts and debug clearing issues
- Supports worktree container deployment vision (Issue #10)

## Pane Organization (Session 9)

All panes now have French names for easy reference:
- **Pierre** (9:0.0): Activity Monitor - DC logs human-readable view
- **Amelie** (9:0.1): File Tree - Project navigation  
- **Sophie** (9:0.2): Emacs Editor - Main editing pane
- **Marcel** (9:0.3): Claude Code - Implementation agent
- **Jacques** (9:0.4): DC Logs Monitor - Raw log view
- **Henri** (9:0.5): Additional workspace

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Marcel's Implementation**
   - Emacs daemon manager development
   - Test when implementation complete
   - Verify auto-file opening works seamlessly

2. **Polish Core Features**
   - Refine translation templates
   - Improve activity formatting
   - Add missing DC commands

3. **Simple Enhancements**
   - Activity grouping by time
   - Better path display
   - Clear activity indicators

## Design Principles

- **Keep it simple**: No databases, no complex state
- **Make it reactive**: Respond to Claude's actions immediately
- **Focus on visibility**: Show what Claude is doing clearly
- **Perfect one agent**: Before considering multi-agent again

## Success Criteria

By end of next session:
- [ ] All common DC commands translated perfectly
- [ ] File/directory opening works seamlessly
- [ ] Activity stream is clear and helpful
- [ ] Ready to add Claude Code support

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

- ❌ Multi-agent context management (archived)
- ❌ Database persistence
- ❌ Complex pane routing
- ❌ State management beyond current session

Keep the focus tight and the implementation clean!
