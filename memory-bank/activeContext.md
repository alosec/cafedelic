# Active Context

## Current State (2025-05-26)

### Back to Basics - Single Agent Focus
After exploring multi-agent orchestration, we've returned to focusing on perfecting single-agent Claude Desktop integration. The multi-agent work has been archived in `feature/multi-agent-experiment` branch for potential future use.

### What's Working Well ✅
1. **DC Log Watching**: Successfully monitors and translates Desktop Commander logs
2. **Tab Character Parsing**: Fixed robust parsing of DC logs with tab characters
3. **Basic Activity Tracking**: Shows what Claude is doing in human-readable format  
4. **Simple MCP Integration**: `get_active_context` returns activity summaries
5. **Dired Integration**: Auto-opens directories when Claude explores them
6. **Tmux Output Routing**: Routes emacs output to session 9:0.2 for visibility
7. **IDE Layout**: Clean 5-pane tmux layout with tmex

### Immediate Focus Areas

#### 1. Perfect DC Log Translation
- Add more command templates as we discover them
- Improve file path formatting and display
- Group related activities intelligently

#### 2. Automatic File Opening
- When Claude reads a file → open in Emacs
- When Claude explores a directory → open in dired
- Keep it reactive and simple (no complex state)

#### 3. Activity Dashboard
- Simple web UI for activity stream
- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Clean, readable display of Claude's work

#### 4. Test with Real Claude Desktop
- Verify all translations are accurate
- Ensure file/directory opening is smooth
- Gather feedback on what's most helpful

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   - Run monitor-dc-logs.js
   - Use Claude Desktop for real tasks
   - Verify auto-opening works

2. **Polish Core Features**
   - Refine translation templates
   - Improve activity formatting
   - Add missing DC commands

3. **Simple Enhancements**
   - Activity grouping by time
   - Better path display
   - Clear activity indicators

## Design Principles

- **Keep it simple**: No databases, no complex state
- **Make it reactive**: Respond to Claude's actions immediately
- **Focus on visibility**: Show what Claude is doing clearly
- **Perfect one agent**: Before considering multi-agent again

## Success Criteria

By end of next session:
- [ ] All common DC commands translated perfectly
- [ ] File/directory opening works seamlessly
- [ ] Activity stream is clear and helpful
- [ ] Ready to add Claude Code support

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

- ❌ Multi-agent context management
- ❌ Database persistence
- ❌ Complex pane routing
- ❌ State management beyond current session

Keep the focus tight and the implementation clean!
