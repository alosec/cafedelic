# Progress Tracking

## Project Initialization (2025-05-25)

### âœ… Vision Established
- Cafedelic defined as intelligence framework
- Clear separation from tmux/layout concerns
- Focus on development transparency

### âœ… Memory Bank Created
- Core documentation files written
- Clear scope and architecture defined
- Implementation path outlined
- .clauderules established with project intelligence

### âœ… Code Cleanup Complete
- [x] Removed launch_ide tool
- [x] Removed terminal launcher
- [x] Updated tool registration
- [x] Renamed get_context to get_active_context

### âœ… DC Log Watcher Implemented
- [x] Created WatcherService with polling
- [x] Created TranslatorService with templates
- [x] Created ActivityStore for memory
- [x] Wired services in Express server
- [x] Connected to get_active_context tool
- [x] Created standalone monitor script
- [x] Fixed log parsing for pipe-delimited format
- [x] Fixed monitor script import paths

## Current State (2025-05-26)

### âœ… Return to Single-Agent Focus
Successfully simplified architecture:
- [x] Archived multi-agent work in feature branch
- [x] Reset to stable commit 6646078
- [x] Preserved all working features
- [x] Updated documentation for clarity

### âœ… Working Features
- **DC Log Monitoring**: Real-time translation of Desktop Commander actions
- **Activity Tracking**: Human-readable activity summaries
- **Dired Integration**: Auto-opens directories in Emacs
- **IDE Layout**: Clean 5-pane tmux setup with tmex
- **MCP Tools**: get_active_context, split_pane_*, toggle_auto_open, assign_pane_role, get_output_routing
- **Output Routing**: Messages route to configured panes (9:0.2)
- **Emacs Daemon**: Managed by EmacsDaemonManager (needs socket fix)

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Queue

#### Immediate (This Session) âœ…
- [x] **Fix DC log parsing** - Resolved tab character parsing issues
- [x] **Route emacs output to tmux** - Output now goes to session 9:0.2
- [x] **Test complete parsing flow** - All `list_directory` commands now parse correctly
- [x] **Verify dired auto-opening setup** - Scripts updated and tested

#### Next Session
- [ ] **Architecture Planning**: Design Output Routing Management System (Issue #4)
- [ ] Test with running emacs daemon for complete integration
- [ ] Verify real-time dired opening during Claude Desktop usage
- [ ] Add file auto-opening (not just directories)
- [ ] Create simple web dashboard for activity
- [ ] Improve activity grouping and formatting
- [ ] Add time-based activity summaries

#### Future (After Output Routing System)
- [ ] Implement flexible source â†’ destination assignment
- [ ] Add emacs daemon lifecycle management
- [ ] Create MCP tools for managing routing rules
- [ ] Support multiple output destinations per source

#### Future (After Single-Agent Perfect)
- [ ] Claude Code log discovery and monitoring
- [ ] Unified activity stream for multiple tools
- [ ] Pattern detection and insights
- [ ] Consider persistence (SQLite) only when needed

#### Cafedelic Vision Platform (After Core Features)
- [ ] Dockerize server with Debian 12 base
- [ ] Dynamic worktree discovery system
- [ ] Four colored servers (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) in tmux grid
- [ ] 3 panes per server (editor, terminal, Claude Code)
- [ ] Enhanced agent communication tool
- [ ] `deploy_cafedelic()` automation function
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration capabilities

## Definition of Done

### Phase 1: DC Monitoring âœ…
- DC logs are watched in real-time
- Log entries are translated to human readable
- Activity stream is accessible via MCP

### Phase 2: Auto-Opening (Current)
- Files open automatically in Emacs
- Directories open in dired
- Clean, reactive implementation

### Phase 3: Activity Dashboard (Next)
- Web UI shows live activity
- Clear, grouped display
- Useful for development visibility
