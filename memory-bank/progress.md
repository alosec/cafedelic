## Current State Summary

### What's Working
- Real-time MCP log monitoring from Claude Desktop
- Dynamic routing to any user-specified tmux pane
- Automatic file/directory opening in emacs
- Flexible layout management with TMEX
- Human-readable activity translations
- Event-driven service architecture

### What's Not Working

- Some MCP tool parameter issues

## In Progress ðŸ”„

### Pane Display Abstraction (Issue #7)
- [ ] Design unified display API
- [ ] Implement PaneDisplayManager
- [ ] Add display providers
- [ ] Create verification system

## Upcoming Priorities ðŸ“‹

### Near Term (This Week)
1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - [ ] Unit tests for services
   - [ ] Integration tests for routing
   - [ ] MCP tool testing

2. **Missing Tmux Tools**
   - [ ] assign_name_to_pane
   - [ ] read_pane_by_name
   - [ ] send_keys_to_pane_by_name

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] User guide for routing
   - [ ] Troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Architecture diagrams

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Persistence Layer**
   - [ ] SQLite for routing config
   - [ ] Activity history storage
   - [ ] Configuration management

2. **Enhanced UI**
   - [ ] Web dashboard
   - [ ] Real-time activity view
   - [ ] Configuration interface

### Long Term (Future)
1. **Multi-Agent Platform**
   - [ ] Docker containers
   - [ ] Agent coordination
   - [ ] Shared context

2. **Intelligence Features**
   - [ ] Pattern detection
   - [ ] Workflow analysis
   - [ ] Optimization suggestions

## Metrics

### Code Statistics
- Services: 4 core implementations
- MCP Tools: 13 functional tools
- Shell Scripts: 10+ integration scripts
- Lines of Code: ~2000 (TypeScript)

### Integration Points
- Claude Desktop: âœ… Full MCP integration
- Tmux: âœ… Dynamic pane routing
- Emacs: âœ… Server per pane model
- TMEX: âœ… Layout automation

### Performance
- Log Discovery: <100ms
- Translation: <10ms per entry
- Routing: <50ms per operation
- File Opening: <200ms typical
