# Progress

## Project Status: Intelligence Layer for Claude Code (V3)

### Foundation Complete (V2 WTE)
**Architecture**: Watch-Transform-Execute pattern proven and retained
**Codebase**: ~150 lines core implementation as foundation
**Integration**: Emacs auto-opening works, now part of display adapters
**Property System**: Multi-dimensional pane management integrated into terminal adapter

### Current Focus: MCP Intelligence Platform  
**Vision**: Database-driven intelligence layer for AI-assisted development
**Approach**: MCP server with conversational interface and SQLite core
**Status**: Architecture finalized, implementation ready to begin

## Completed Decisions âœ…

### V3 Architectural Choices (FINALIZED)
- **MCP Intelligence Platform**: Primary interface through conversational tools
- **Database-First Design**: SQLite as single source of truth for all intelligence
- **Display Adapter Pattern**: Separate intelligence from presentation layer
- **Assistant-Agnostic Schema**: Support Claude Code now, others later
- **Enhancement Philosophy**: Integrate with existing tools, don't replace them
- **Local-First Approach**: All data stored locally, privacy-focused

### Technical Foundation (V2 â†’ V3)
- **WTE pipeline**: Retained as activity monitoring foundation
- **Property system**: Integrated into terminal display adapter
- **Script library**: Available through terminal adapter for backward compatibility
- **MCP architecture**: Evolved from tools to full intelligence server
- **Database intelligence**: New capability for rich analysis and coordination

## Implementation Priorities ðŸš€

### Phase 1: Intelligence Platform Core (CURRENT FOCUS)
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Implement complete SQLite schema for projects, sessions, activities
- [ ] **MCP Server**: Core server with tool registration and request handling
- [ ] **Project Management Tools**: create_project, read_project_status, list_active_projects
- [ ] **Session Management Tools**: create_session, read_session_context, terminate_session
- [ ] **Claude Code Integration**: Process monitoring, log parsing, activity extraction
- [ ] **Basic Intelligence**: claude -p integration for context analysis

### Phase 2: Advanced Intelligence Features
- [ ] **Cross-Session Analysis**: Pattern recognition and coordination opportunities
- [ ] **Session Health Monitoring**: Predictive analysis for stuck/struggling sessions
- [ ] **Context Management**: Session snapshots, context sharing between sessions
- [ ] **Display Adapters**: Terminal adapter for tmux integration, VS Code extension foundation
- [ ] **Intelligence Insights**: Automated insight generation and recommendations

### Phase 3: Multi-Assistant Platform
- [ ] **Assistant Abstraction**: Support for Cline, Cursor, future AI assistants
- [ ] **Advanced Orchestration**: Workflow automation and multi-assistant coordination
- [ ] **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, project sharing, advanced analytics
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Scaling for large projects and many sessions

## Key Insights from Research

### Claude Code SDK
- Official SDK released May 2025
- Enables programmatic session control
- TypeScript and Python support
- Direct API connection without middleware

### Session Management Tools
- **claude-squad**: Tmux-based multi-session manager
- **CCmanager**: TUI without tmux dependency
- Both use human-friendly naming over session IDs
- We'll integrate best patterns into cafe

### Performance Targets
- **cafe init**: < 1 second to working IDE
- **Direct scripts**: ~10ms execution time
- **Database queries**: < 50ms for recent system events
- **Session creation**: < 500ms with tracking

## Architecture Evolution
1. **V1**: Complex services (~2000 lines, deprecated for complexity)
2. **V2**: Clean WTE pattern (~150 lines, proven and retained)
3. **V3**: MCP Intelligence Platform (database-driven with conversational interface)

## What Makes This Different

### From Other AI Development Tools
- **Intelligence-First**: Focus on understanding and coordinating AI work, not replacing tools
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language MCP tools for all operations
- **Database-Driven Intelligence**: Rich analysis and pattern recognition across sessions
- **Assistant-Agnostic**: Foundation for Claude Code, Cline, future AI assistants

### From Previous Cafedelic Versions
- **Database-Centric**: SQLite as single source of truth vs. file-based approaches
- **MCP-Native**: Conversational tools vs. CLI commands or direct script execution
- **Intelligence Layer**: Coordination and analysis vs. simple automation
- **Display Separation**: Plugin adapters vs. tightly coupled terminal integration
## Implementation Readiness

### V3 Architecture Complete âœ…
- **Conceptual Framework**: Intelligence layer with MCP interface finalized
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive tables designed for projects, sessions, activities, context
- **MCP Toolset**: Complete specification for conversational project/session management  
- **Technical Stack**: Database-first with TypeScript MCP server and display adapters
- **Integration Strategy**: Claude Code monitoring and claude -p intelligence processing

### Next Implementation Steps
1. **Database Implementation**: Create SQLite schema and migration system
2. **MCP Server Core**: Basic server with tool registration and request handling
3. **Project Tools**: Implement create_project, read_project_status, list_active_projects
4. **Claude Code Integration**: Process monitoring and activity extraction
5. **Terminal Display Adapter**: Basic tmux integration for status display

## Design Philosophy Summary

Cafedelic V3 represents a fundamental shift from **tool building** to **intelligence provision**. Rather than creating another development interface, we're building the intelligence layer that makes AI-assisted development visible, manageable, and coordinatable.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Make AI Work Visible**: Transform black box AI conversations into observable, understandable activities
- **Enable AI Coordination**: Manage multiple Claude Code sessions with cross-session intelligence
- **Preserve User Choice**: Enhance existing tools rather than replacing them
- **Database-Driven Intelligence**: Rich analysis, pattern recognition, and insight generation

### Technical Excellence
- **Local-First**: All data stays on user's machine, privacy-focused
- **Conversation-Native**: MCP interface designed for natural language interaction
- **Performance-Oriented**: SQLite queries <50ms, real-time activity processing
- **Assistant-Agnostic**: Foundation supports Claude Code, Cline, future AI assistants

The architecture is finalized, documentation is complete, and implementation is ready to begin. Cafedelic V3 will transform how developers work with AI assistants by providing the missing intelligence layer that makes AI development work truly collaborative and transparent.
