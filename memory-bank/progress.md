# Progress Tracking

## Project Initialization (2025-05-25)

### âœ… Vision Established
- Cafedelic defined as intelligence framework
- Clear separation from tmux/layout concerns
- Focus on development transparency

### âœ… Memory Bank Created
- Core documentation files written
- Clear scope and architecture defined
- Implementation path outlined
- .clauderules established with project intelligence

### âœ… Code Cleanup Complete
- [x] Removed launch_ide tool
- [x] Removed terminal launcher
- [x] Updated tool registration
- [x] Renamed get_context to get_active_context

### âœ… DC Log Watcher Implemented
- [x] Created WatcherService with polling
- [x] Created TranslatorService with templates
- [x] Created ActivityStore for memory
- [x] Wired services in Express server
- [x] Connected to get_active_context tool
- [x] Created standalone monitor script
- [x] Fixed log parsing for pipe-delimited format
- [x] Fixed monitor script import paths

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Queue

#### Phase 1: DC Log Translation (Current)
- [ ] Create WatcherService
- [ ] Create TranslatorService  
- [ ] Wire up Express server
- [ ] Basic activity streaming

#### Phase 2: Context Engine (Next)
- [ ] Implement get_active_context âœ… (Basic version complete)
- [ ] Add activity summarization âœ… 
- [ ] Create pattern detection âœ… (Basic patterns)
- [ ] Build context accumulation
- [ ] **NEW: Emacs buffer management integration** (Planned)

#### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Future)
- [ ] SQLite3 integration
- [ ] Historical analysis
- [ ] Claude -p automation
- [ ] Advanced querying

## Recent Achievements (2025-05-25)

### âœ… Real-World Testing Success
First live test with Claude Desktop showed immediate value:
- Clear visibility into file exploration
- Detected read_multiple_files patterns
- Identified opportunity for Emacs integration

### âœ… Emacs Integration Started (2025-05-26)
Basic emacsclient communication established:
- Created hello world script: open-file-test.sh
- Verified file opening works
- Established script directory structure

### ðŸ“‹ Window Management Phase (Current)
Building two-buffer system:
- [ ] init-claude-view.sh - Set up split windows
- [ ] open-right.sh - Open files in Claude's buffer
- [ ] Buffer naming with claude- prefix
- [ ] Preserve user's left buffer

## Technical Decisions

### Confirmed
- Express.js for server
- Chokidar for file watching
- Template-based translation
- Event-driven architecture

### Deferred
- Database implementation
- Real-time delivery method
- Analysis algorithms
- Storage schema

## Lessons Learned

From teemax and deli:
- Simple scripts beat complex frameworks
- Start with working prototypes
- Focus on single responsibility
- Prove value before scaling

## Next Actions

1. Clean up deprecated code
2. Implement basic DC log watcher
3. Create simple translator
4. Test end-to-end flow
5. Document learnings

## Definition of Done

Feature #1 complete when:
- DC logs are watched in real-time
- Log entries are translated to human readable
- Activity stream is accessible
- No tmux dependencies remain
