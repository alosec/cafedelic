# Progress

## Project Status: Pivoting to Claude Code IDE (V3)

### Foundation Complete (V2 WTE)
**Architecture**: Watch-Transform-Execute pattern proven
**Codebase**: ~150 lines core implementation  
**Integration**: Emacs auto-opening works seamlessly
**Property System**: Multi-dimensional pane management ready

### Current Focus: Claude Code IDE & cafe CLI
**Vision**: Integrated AI pair programming environment
**Approach**: CLI-first with direct script execution
**Status**: Architecture designed, implementation starting

## Completed Decisions âœ…

### Architectural Choices (UPDATED SCOPE)
- **Keep all MCP tools**: No deprecation, maximum flexibility
- **CLI-first interface**: cafe command suite as primary UX
- **Direct script calls**: Bypass MCP layer for CLI operations
- **70/30 layout**: Simple 2-pane default (emacs/system events)
- **SQLite messages**: Database-backed activity tracking (future)
- **Validation first**: cafe init ensures operational state

### Technical Foundation
- **WTE pipeline**: Proven event-driven architecture
- **Property system**: Source/role/name pane identification
- **Script library**: Robust bash scripts for all operations
- **MCP servers**: Both stdio and HTTP implementations working

## Implementation Priorities ðŸš€

### Phase 1: cafe CLI Foundation (IMMEDIATE FOCUS)
- [ ] Main cafe entry script with subcommand routing
- [ ] cafe init - Validate server running, check dependencies, return errors
- [ ] cafe deploy - Simple 2-pane layout (70% emacs, 30% system events)
- [ ] Direct script invocation pattern
- [ ] Basic error handling and user feedback

### Phase 2: Core Features (NEXT)
- [ ] System events database with reactive display
- [ ] cafe events - SQLite system event viewer
- [ ] Layout presets (minimal, full)
- [ ] Integration with existing WTE pipeline
### Phase 3: Claude Code Integration
- [ ] SDK subprocess management
- [ ] Multi-session coordination
- [ ] Activity aggregation across sessions
- [ ] Token usage tracking

## Key Insights from Research

### Claude Code SDK
- Official SDK released May 2025
- Enables programmatic session control
- TypeScript and Python support
- Direct API connection without middleware

### Session Management Tools
- **claude-squad**: Tmux-based multi-session manager
- **CCmanager**: TUI without tmux dependency
- Both use human-friendly naming over session IDs
- We'll integrate best patterns into cafe

### Performance Targets
- **cafe init**: < 1 second to working IDE
- **Direct scripts**: ~10ms execution time
- **Database queries**: < 50ms for recent system events
- **Session creation**: < 500ms with tracking

## Architecture Evolution
1. **V1**: Complex services (deprecated)
2. **V2**: Clean WTE pattern (foundation)
3. **V3**: Claude Code IDE (building now)

## What Makes This Different

### From Other Tools
- **Deeply tmux-native**: Not abstracting, enhancing
- **CLI-first**: Simple commands, powerful results
- **Database-backed**: Rich history and queries
- **Session-oriented**: Built for multi-Claude workflows

### From Previous Versions
- **Focused purpose**: AI pair programming, not general orchestration
- **Direct execution**: No middleware overhead
- **Human-centric**: Friendly names, not technical IDs
- **Reactive displays**: Live updates, not just text pushing
## Next Session Goals
1. Create cli/cafe main entry script
2. Implement cafe init with 30/70/30 layout
3. Build system events database schema and viewer
4. Create session tracking structure
5. Test direct script invocation pattern

## Known Limitations (Acceptable)
- No cross-machine session sync (local-first)
- Requires tmux (by design)
- Bash/SQLite only (simplicity over features)
- No GUI (terminal-native)

## Summary
Cafedelic is transforming from AI transparency framework to integrated Claude Code IDE. The technical foundation is proven (WTE pattern), the property system enables flexible pane management, and the CLI-first approach will make complex workflows simple. 

The shift to direct script execution and database-backed displays represents a commitment to performance and user experience over architectural purity. By studying tools like claude-squad and CCmanager, we're building on proven patterns while maintaining our tmux-native philosophy.

Ready to build the future of AI pair programming.
