- [ ] **Advanced Orchestration**: Workflow automation and multi-assistant coordination
- [ ] **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, project sharing, advanced analytics
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Scaling for large projects and many sessions

## Key Insights from Research

### Claude Code SDK
- Official SDK released May 2025
- Enables programmatic session control
- TypeScript and Python support
- Direct API connection without middleware

### Session Management Tools
- **claude-squad**: Tmux-based multi-session manager
- **CCmanager**: TUI without tmux dependency
- Both use human-friendly naming over session IDs
- We'll integrate best patterns into cafe

### Performance Targets
- **cafe init**: < 1 second to working IDE
- **Direct scripts**: ~10ms execution time
- **Database queries**: < 50ms for recent system events
- **Session creation**: < 500ms with tracking

## Architecture Evolution
1. **V1**: Complex services (~2000 lines, deprecated for complexity)
2. **V2**: Clean WTE pattern (~150 lines, proven and retained)
3. **V3**: MCP Intelligence Platform (database-driven with conversational interface)

## What Makes This Different

### From Other AI Development Tools
- **Intelligence-First**: Focus on understanding and coordinating AI work, not replacing tools
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language MCP tools for all operations
- **Database-Driven Intelligence**: Rich analysis and pattern recognition across sessions
- **Assistant-Agnostic**: Foundation for Claude Code, Cline, future AI assistants

### From Previous Cafedelic Versions
- **Database-Centric**: SQLite as single source of truth vs. file-based approaches
- **MCP-Native**: Conversational tools vs. CLI commands or direct script execution
- **Intelligence Layer**: Coordination and analysis vs. simple automation
- **Display Separation**: Plugin adapters vs. tightly coupled terminal integration
## Implementation Readiness

### V3 Architecture Complete âœ…
- **Conceptual Framework**: Intelligence layer with MCP interface finalized
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive tables designed for projects, sessions, activities, context
- **MCP Toolset**: Complete specification for conversational project/session management  
- **Technical Stack**: Database-first with TypeScript MCP server and display adapters
- **Integration Strategy**: Claude Code monitoring and claude -p intelligence processing

### Next Implementation Steps
1. **Database Implementation**: Create SQLite schema and migration system
2. **MCP Server Core**: Basic server with tool registration and request handling
3. **Project Tools**: Implement create_project, read_project_status, list_active_projects
4. **Claude Code Integration**: Process monitoring and activity extraction
5. **Terminal Display Adapter**: Basic tmux integration for status display

## Design Philosophy Summary

Cafedelic V3 represents a fundamental shift from **tool building** to **intelligence provision**. Rather than creating another development interface, we're building the intelligence layer that makes AI-assisted development visible, manageable, and coordinatable.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Make AI Work Visible**: Transform black box AI conversations into observable, understandable activities
- **Enable AI Coordination**: Manage multiple Claude Code sessions with cross-session intelligence
- **Preserve User Choice**: Enhance existing tools rather than replacing them
- **Database-Driven Intelligence**: Rich analysis, pattern recognition, and insight generation

### Technical Excellence
- **Local-First**: All data stays on user's machine, privacy-focused
- **Conversation-Native**: MCP interface designed for natural language interaction
- **Performance-Oriented**: SQLite queries <50ms, real-time activity processing
- **Assistant-Agnostic**: Foundation supports Claude Code, Cline, future AI assistants

The architecture is finalized, documentation is complete, and implementation is ready to begin. Cafedelic V3 will transform how developers work with AI assistants by providing the missing intelligence layer that makes AI development work truly collaborative and transparent.
