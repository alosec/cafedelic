# Progress

## Project Status: V2 Complete - Ready for Features

### Current Implementation (V2)
**Architecture**: Watch-Transform-Execute (WTE) pattern
**Codebase**: ~150 lines (from ~2000 in v1)
**Status**: Fully functional and merged to main

## What Works âœ…

### Core Functionality
- **MCP Log Watching**: Direct file watching with readline
- **File Operation Detection**: Parses Claude Desktop file operations
- **Emacs Integration**: Auto-opens files/directories using property-based pane discovery
- **Pipeline Composition**: Clean functional data flow with `pipe()`
- **Property-Based Routing**: Uses @source and @role for intelligent pane selection

### MCP Tools (Enhanced with Properties)
- `assign_pane_properties` - Set name, source, and/or role on a pane
- `list_panes_by_properties` - Filter panes by any property combination
- `find_pane_by_source_and_role` - Direct lookup with exact match
- `setEditorDestination` - Route output to specific tmux panes
- `create_tmex_layout` - Create complex tmux layouts
- `toggle_auto_open` - Control automatic file opening
- `get_active_context` - Retrieve recent activity
- All routing and layout management tools

### Technical Achievements
- 10x code reduction while maintaining all features
- Eliminated complex service architecture
- Direct, understandable code flow
- Easy to extend and modify

## Current Capabilities

### File Operations
- Detects when Claude reads/writes files
- Automatically opens them in Emacs
- Routes to user-specified tmux panes
- Maintains activity context

### Architecture Benefits
- Add new watchers for different data sources
- Create transforms for any data shape
- Build executors for any action
- Compose pipelines trivially

## What's Next ðŸš€

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Claude Desktop Visibility**
   - Show AI actions in real-time
   - Create activity dashboards
   - Build visual feedback systems

2. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Direct tool execution
   - Code-specific transforms
   - Enhanced file operations

3. **Pipeline Enhancements**
   - Conditional routing
   - Multi-stage transforms
   - Parallel execution

### Feature Possibilities
With the clean WTE architecture, we can now easily add:
- Git operation monitoring
- Terminal command tracking
- Browser action visibility
- Custom notification systems
- Any transform/execute combination

## Development Status

### Completed Milestones
- [x] V2 architecture design
- [x] WTE pattern implementation
- [x] Core pipeline working
- [x] V1 feature parity
- [x] 10x code reduction
- [x] Merge to main
- [x] Issue #11 closed
- [x] Issue #16 property-based consolidation

### Ready to Build
- [ ] Claude Desktop visibility features
- [ ] Claude Code tool integration
- [ ] Advanced routing options
- [ ] Activity analytics
- [ ] Custom pipelines

## Known Limitations
- No persistence (routing resets on restart)
- Basic error handling
- Limited test coverage
- Single pipeline model (intentionally simple)

## Technical Foundation
The v2 implementation provides:
- Clear extension points
- Minimal dependencies
- Direct debugging paths
- Simple mental model

## Summary
V2 redesign complete. The system now does exactly what it needs to with minimal complexity. Ready to rapidly build new features on this solid foundation.
